# Project Overview:
Applied supervised learning techniques and an analytical mind on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify the people that most likely to donate to their cause. Explored the data to learn how the census data is recorded and applied a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format. Then evaluated several supervised learning techniques in sklearn on the data, and picked best solution. Optimized the selected model and presented it as a solution to CharityML. Finally explored the chosen model and its predictions under the hood, to see just how well it’s performing when considering the data it’s given.

# Project Highlights:
This project was designed to get acquainted with the many supervised learning algorithms available in sklearn, and to also provide for a method of evaluating just how each model works and performs on a certain type of data. It is important in machine learning to understand exactly when and where a certain algorithm should be used, and when one should be avoided.

# Things I Learnt by Completing this Project:
- How to identify when preprocessing is needed, and how to apply it.
- How to establish a benchmark for a solution to the problem.
- What each of several supervised learning algorithms accomplishes given a specific dataset.
- How to investigate whether a candidate solution model is adequate for the problem.
